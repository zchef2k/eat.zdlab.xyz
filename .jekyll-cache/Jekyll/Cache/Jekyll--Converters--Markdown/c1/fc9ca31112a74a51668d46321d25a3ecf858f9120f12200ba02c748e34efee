I"ë<p>There are many focaccia recipes out there, this one is mine. As with all bread recipes, where most of them differ is hydration- the relationship between wet and dry ingredients in the dough. While most rational people would agree thereâ€™s not a single perfect ratio, there are circumstances why youâ€™d choose lower versus higher and vice versa. For my kitchen, its oven, and the brands of ingredients I prefer, this recipe at 70% works for me. Working with high hydration dough can be intimidating at first, but once you understand the role autolyzation plays and how gluten is developed using the â€œstretch/slap and foldâ€ method, your confidence will build. Practice makes perfect, so donâ€™t be afraid to fail- just donâ€™t give up.</p>
