I"	<p>Collard greens grow year-round in the South. They’re typically planted in spring and fall for separate harvests in summer and winter. Inarguably, winter collards are better. I learned this lesson in 2005 while living “Down East” in North Carolina’s Crystal Coast. The sandy soil of the coastal plain produces collards that are dynamically coarse and sweet in colder weather than those picked the heat of summer. These plants tolerate longer cook times which lead to better texture and more complex flavor.</p>
