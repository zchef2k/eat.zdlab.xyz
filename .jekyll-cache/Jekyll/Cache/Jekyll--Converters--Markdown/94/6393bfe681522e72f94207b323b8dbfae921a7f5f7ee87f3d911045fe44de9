  <li>Combine starter, water, flour, yeast and sugar in a large bowl. Stir with spoon until thoroughly combined, but do not over mix.</li>
  <li>Cover the bowl and let the mass sit for one hour to autolyze.</li>
  <li>After the first hour, wet your hands and perform a round of ‚Äústretch and folds‚Äù to the dough.</li>
  <li>After 30 minutes, repeat this action. Continue to wet your hands in order to handle the still sticky dough.</li>
  <li>After another 30 minutes, repeat. At this point, the gluten in the flour should be developed enough to handle the dough more easily.</li>
  <li>After 30 minutes more, work the oil and salt into the dough by stretching and folding the dough and working the salt in as you handle it.</li>
  <li>Turn the dough into an oiled 9x13(-ish) baking pan, gently spread the dough outward and cover. It will eventually settle itself into the corners.</li>
  <li>When ready to bake (more on this below), preheat your oven to 450F with a baking stone in the center rack. Give the stone time to heat.</li>
  <li>Before placing the pan in the oven, oil your fingertips and slowly press them into the dough to ensure a consistent ‚Äúcrumb‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the rosemary and some salt over the dough and drizzle generously with extra virgin olive oil.</li>
  <li>Bake for 22-25 minutes. If concerned about doneness, and internal temperature of 195 should indicate the bread is ready.</li>
  <li>Allow to rest for 20 minutes or so until ready to cut and serve.</li>
