Two of the peppers in this batch rank as "superhots": predictably, the Hellboy and the Ghost. The CAP 455 is a heatless pepper with sweet flavor akin to a red bell, but stronger, and is the perfect foil to the pain the others bring. On its own, the sauce from the ferment would be quite flavorful; though too hot for most people to notice, let alone enjoy. For this, I felt the batch deserved more to take it to the next level.

The peppers and aromatics were strained, smoked over hardwood pellets for 3 hours, cooled, then recombined with the brine and pureed. Meanwhile, I made a classic barbecue sauce of toasted spices, caramelized tomato paste and sweet things, and a super-rich beef stock I rolled the weekend prior. Equal amounts of both sauces come together to create **Bull and Cinder**. "Bull" to celebrate the hard work of the [local farmers](https://www.ptbfarm.com/) from whom I bought the bones to make the stock, and "Cinder" to remind you of the smokiness and searing heat this bottle delivers.
