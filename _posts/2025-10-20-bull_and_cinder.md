Two of the peppers in this batch rank as "superhots"- predictably the Hellboy and the Ghost. The CAP 455 is a heatless pepper with sweet flavor akin to a red bell, but stronger, and is the perfect foil to the pain the others bring. On its own, the sauce from the ferment would be quite flavorful but too hot to notice, let alone enjoy. For this, I wanted to add other elements to really take this batch to the next level.

The peppers and aromatics were strained, smoked over hardwood pellets for 3 hours, cooled, then recombined with the brine and pureed. Meanwhile, I made a classic barbecue sauce of toasted spices, caramelized tomato paste and sweet things, and a super-rich beef stock I had rolled the weekend before. Equal batches of both sauce come together to create this- Bull and Cinder. "Bull" to celebrate the hard work of the farmers from whom I bought the bones to make the stock and "Cinder" to remind you of the smokiness and searing heat this bottle brings.
