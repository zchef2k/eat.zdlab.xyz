My friend Mark has gotten into breeding peppers the past couple years and this sauce comes from specific varieties that are new to him this season. The Aji pineapple, however, is familiar to us by way of its cousins we've grown previously: Aji amarillo, Aji limon, and the like. The Bonda Ma Jacques is a fun pepper also with a familiar pedigree, the habanero. It's every bit as hot as a habanero with an aroma and flavor of its own. As I typically do with their relatives, I've added fruit to the ferment to compliment the flavors and help ease the upfront punch these peppers bring.
