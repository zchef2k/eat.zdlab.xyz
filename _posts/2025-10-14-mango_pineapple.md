My friend Mark has gotten into breeding peppers the past couple years and this sauce comes from a couple varieties that are new to him this season. The Aji pineapple is familiar to us by way of its cousins which we've also grown- Aji amarillo, Aji limon, and others. The Bonda Ma Jacques is a fun pepper also with a familiar pedigree, the habanero. It's every bit as hot as a habanero with an aroma and flavor of its own. Like I typically do with their relatives, I've added fruit to the ferment to compliment their flavors and help ease the up front punch these peppers bring.
