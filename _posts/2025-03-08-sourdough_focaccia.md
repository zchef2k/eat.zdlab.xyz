recipe:
  servings: Serves 8
  prep: 2-3 hours of work over 1-3 days
  cook: 25 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 250 g sourdough starter
    * 350 g water, tepid
    * 550 g all-purpose flour
    * 2 t dried yeast
    * 2 t sugar
    * 14 g kosher salt
    * 25 g extra virgin olive oil
    * .5 T rosemary, rough chopped
  directions_markdown: |-
    * Combine starter, water, flour, yeast and sugar in a large bowl. Stir with spoon until thoroughly combined, but do not over mix.
    * Cover the bowl and let the mass sit for one hour to autolyze.
    * After the first hour, wet your hands and perform a round of "stretch and folds" to the dough.
    * After 30 minutes, repeat this action. Continue to wet your hands in order to handle the still sticky dough.
    * After another 30 minutes, repeat. At this point, the gluten in the flour should be developed enough to handle the dough more easily.
    * After 30 minutes more, work the oil and salt into the dough by stretching and folding the dough and working the salt in as you handle it.
    * Turn the dough into an oiled 9x13(-ish) baking pan, gently spread the dough outward and cover. It will eventually settle itself into the corners.
    * When ready to bake (see above), preheat your oven to 450F with a baking stone in the center rack. Give the stone time to heat.
    * Before placing the pan in the oven, oil your fingertips and slowly press them into the dough to ensure a consistent "crumb".
    * Sprinkle the rosemary and some salt over the dough and drizzle generously with extra virgin olive oil.
    * Bake for 22-25 minutes. If concerned about doneness, and internal temperature of 195 should indicate the bread is ready.
    * Allow to rest for 20 minutes or so until ready to cut and serve.

There are many focaccia recipes out there, this one is mine. As with all bread recipes, where most of them differ is hydration- the relationship between wet and dry ingredients in the dough. While most rational people would agree there's not a single perfect ratio, there are circumstances why you'd choose lower versus higher and vice versa. For my kitchen, its oven, and the brands of ingredients I prefer, this recipe at 70% works for me. Working with high hydration dough can be intimidating at first, but once you understand the role autolyzation plays and how gluten is developed using the "stretch/slap and fold" method, your confidence will build. Practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to fail- just don't give up.

On fermentation, the dough will develop more flavor the longer the yeasts and bacteria feed- typically no longer than 72 hours. I minimally let it bulk ferment 24 hours in the refrigerator, though you can do this all within one day and it will still be great.

Enjoy.
