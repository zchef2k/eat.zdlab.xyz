This is the first batch of hot sauce for the year thanks to my friend Mark who continues to grow and breed some of the most exotic peppers around today. This is the first season he's brought me the Tangerine Tiger- a deliciously snackable pepper with a slight but respectable punch given its fruitiness. I wanted to keep this batch simple to highlight the natural flavor of the peppers with minimal aromatics and sugar to round out the ferment.
