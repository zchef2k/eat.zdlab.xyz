    * Remove large stems from the collards, cut into 2" pieces.
    * Rinse and drain the collards thoroughly.
    * In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat add diced bacon.
    * Evenly render bacon at a moderate pace until just crispy and before fat begins to smoke.
    * Add the diced onion to cool the pan. Continue cooking over medium heat until onions begin to soften.
    * Add the minced garlic and butter.
    * Saute until the garlic has softened and the aromatics have shed most their moisture.

    * Add the chicken stock, vinegar, yeast, mushroom power, fish sauce, and sugar and bring to a simmer.
    * Add the collard greens, increase the heat, and stir until everything comes to a fast simmer.
    * Make sure the pot's contents are at the level of the liquid, reduce to a slow simmer and cover.
    * Cook until the greens begin to tender, about 30-45 minutes depending on preference. Stir occasionally.
    * Salt and pepper and adjust seasonings to taste.
    * Remove from heat, covered, until ready to serve.

Collard greens grow year-round in the South. They're typically planted in spring and fall for separate harvests in summer and winter. Inarguably, winter collards are better. I learned this lesson in 2005 while living "Down East" in North Carolina's Crystal Coast. The sandy soil of the coastal plain produces collards that are dynamically coarse and sweet in colder weather than those picked the heat of summer. These plants tolerate longer cook times which lead to better texture and more complex flavor.

People are rather opinionated when it comes to collards greens. I won't dare suggest this recipe is the best you've ever had; though I am certain if you work within its parameters you'll turn out satisfying batches each time. Collards reach their pinnacle when braised with the right balance of savory, smoky, earthy, acidic, and sweet ingredients.

Enjoy.
